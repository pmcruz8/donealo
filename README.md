### Install Meteor

`curl https://install.meteor.com/ | sh)`

### Run both applications locally. 

`npm start`

### Run home application (for regular users) locally.

`cd home/` 

`npm install`

This app will use the same db as admin. Run it with:

`MONGO_URL=mongodb://localhost:3001/meteor meteor --port 3100`

### Run admin application (for orgs) locally.

`cd admin/`

`npm install`

`meteor run`

### Run MongoDB locally

The app (home or admin) needs to be running in one session. Open a new terminal window (in the same app folder, home or admin) and type:

`meteor mongo`

This will start a shell prompt where you can run commands like: 

  - `show collections`: to print a list of all collections (equivalent to tables in a relational db) on the db.
  - `db.<collection_name>.find()`: to see all items in the collection. 
  - More commands in the [mongoDB shell reference](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/mongo-shell/)
  
### Deploy to Heroku 

`sh deploy.sh`
